User Content is provided by third-party contributors, many of whom may use anonymous screen names. User Content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or deceptive. For example, the Site hosts Employer Pages, which allow User Content to be posted by individuals that may not be affiliated with the Employer who owns the Employer Page, including but not limited to the answers to Q&A questions on Employer Pages.

You must not post any User Content that is unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content. You must also not post any User Content that contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or encourages or causes spamming or flooding.
                        <br />
                        You are prohibited from posting any User Content containing official identification information (whether Your own or of another person), such as social identification number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier. Posting such identification information may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences. SPINCV may remove any such identification information, but does not undertake any obligation to do so, and has no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any posting of such identification information. SPINCV reserves the right to change the display of resume on its Site, including, but not limited to, hiding fields, rearranging its format, and changing visual elements.
                        <br />
                        Although SPINCV has no obligation to do so, SPINCV may monitor User Content, and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof that, in SPINCV’s sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific portion of the Site on which it is posted, or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message, or that SPINCV deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate. If You believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please contact SPINCV immediately so that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal. For clarity, SPINCV does not have any obligation to remove any User Content, and the interpretation of whether any User Content violates any SPINCV policy will always remain within the sole discretion of SPINCV.
                        <br />
                        SPINCV reserves the right to disclose all User Content and other relevant information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in connection with operating the Site; to protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. This means, for example, that SPINCV may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information. As an Employer, when You post a listing for employment on SPINCV (hereinafter “Job Listing”)that You choose to list as confidential, Your identity may be discoverable by request from the government or law enforcement.
                        <br />

         </p>
                        <br />
                        <p><strong>IX. Disclaimer of Liability</strong><br />
            The Site acts as, among other things, a venue for (i) Employers to post job opportunities and search for and evaluate job candidates and (ii) candidates to post resumes and profiles and search for and evaluate job opportunities. SPINCV does not screen or censor the listings, including profiles offered. SPINCV is not involved in, and does not control, the actual transaction between Employers and candidates, or any communications between them. As a result, SPINCV is not responsible for User Content, the quality, safety or legality of the jobs or resumes posted, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of Employers to offer job opportunities to candidates or the ability of candidates to fill job openings and SPINCV makes no representations about any jobs, resumes or User Content on the Site. While SPINCV reserves the right in its sole discretion to remove User Content, job postings, resumes or other material from the Site from time to time, SPINCV does not assume any obligation to do so and to the extent permitted by law, disclaims any liability for failing to take any such action. <br />
            Note that there are risks, including but not limited to the risk of physical harm, of dealing with strangers, underage persons or people acting under false pretenses. You assume all risks associated with dealing with other users with whom You come in contact through the Site. By its very nature other people’s information may be offensive, harmful or inaccurate, and in some cases will be mislabeled or deceptively labeled. We expect that You will use caution and common sense when using the Site. <br />
            Because User authentication on the Internet is difficult, SPINCV cannot and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Because we do not and cannot be involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of participants on the Site, in the event that You have a dispute with one or more Users, You release SPINCV (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes to the fullest extent permitted by law. <br />
            The Site and Content may contain inaccuracies or typographical errors. SPINCV makes no representations about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of the Site or Content. The use of the Site and Content is at Your own risk. Changes are periodically made to the Site and may be made at any time. SPINCV cannot guarantee and does not promise any specific results from use of the Site. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by a User from SPINCV or through or from any the Site shall create any warranty not expressly stated herein. <br />
