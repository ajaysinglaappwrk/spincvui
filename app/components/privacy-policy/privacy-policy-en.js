                            When submitting your "CV" resume online on SPINCV.COM, we will require, in addition to the mandatory information listed, your telephone number. The additional personal information set forth in your online "CV" is there to describe your skills, experiences and job preferences. To this end, it is unnecessary to mention in your online "CV" certain private and personal information related to your personal life, political and religious ideals and/or racial opinion.
                    <br />
                    The online "CV" is the means by which you will be able to receive job offers only if you allow access to them to employers and recruiters who have job offers to submit to you. SPINCV.COM has taken important steps to ensure the security and strictly protects the security of your personal information and respects your choices about how your information is used. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. Although we provide access to our bank of "CVs" only to users who pay a registration fee, we cannot guarantee or be held responsible for the behaviour of any third party.
                    <br />
                    You can remove your "CV" online from SPINCV.COM at any time. The personal information collected will remain stored in our servers for a certain period of time, in case of a possible reuse on your part, as well as for our protection in case of disputes that may arise.
When registering your personal information, you are free to answer or not in the "not required" fields. However, the fields identified as "not required" and not filled in may restrict the personalized services that we may offer you.

                    <br />

                            <strong>Access to your personal information </strong>
                            <br />

                            We provide you with the means to ensure the accuracy of your personal information. You will be able to review and update the information at any time in your virtual office. Here you have the opportunity to :
							<ul>
                                <li>view, modify or update your personal information that you have already given us.</li>
                                <li>sign up. Once you register, you do not have to give us your information anymore. Wherever you go on SPINCV.COM, your information will follow you.</li>

                            <strong>Security</strong>
                            <br />
                            Your personal information will never be exchanged with other users without your permission, except under the conditions specified below in the paragraph "Use of Personal Information". Within our company, data is stored in a password-protected server with limited access. Your information may be stored or processed in Quebec where SPINCV, its representatives or agents and its employees are located.
You also have a very important responsibility to protect your information. No one can see or change your personal information unless they know your username and password, so it is important to keep this information completely confidential. SPINCV cannot be held responsible for possible damages caused by the disclosure of information transmitted over the Internet, considering that the assurance of a flawless security does not exist. Act with vigilance.

                    Vous avez également une responsabilité très importante dans la protection de vos informations. Personne ne peut voir ni modifier vos informations
					personnelles si elle ne connaît pas votre nom d’utilisateur et votre mot de passe; il faut donc conserver ces données entièrement confidentielles. SPINCV
					ne pourra pas être tenu pour responsable à de possibles dommages causés par la divulgation des renseignements transmis sur Internet, considérant que l’assurance
					d’une sécurité sans faille n’existe pas. Agissez avec vigilance.
